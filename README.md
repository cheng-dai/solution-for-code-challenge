# Solution for Motherbrain Full Stack Challenge

This is the solution for the Motherbrain Full Stack Challenge from Cheng.

### How to run the project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` in the backend and frontend folders respectively.
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in the browser.


### Things I want to improve
- The zoom performance of the second chart is not ideal. 
- The layout of the page is not very mobile-friendly. I would like to find a better way to display the charts on mobile devices.
